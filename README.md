# Predicting_Individual_Components_of_Total_Time_taken_by_a_Rake_at_some_TXR_Stations


This project focuses on predicting the rake turnaround times at the examination station DDU through the development of predictive machine learning models. Leveraging a dataset of rake movement and examination details, the methodology involved robust data preprocessing, followed by extensive feature engineering, including cyclical time components, rake type encodings, and novel congestion-based metrics quantifying real-time station occupancy across various operational phases (shunting, examination, departure).

Regression models: Random Forest Regressor, Support Vector Regressor, K â€“ Nearest Neighbour, XGBoost Regressor, and LightGBM Regressor, were trained and evaluated on individual station dataset (DDU) to predict critical durations: Arrival to Placement, Placement to Release, and Release to Departure. A significant improvement in model performance, particularly evidenced by an increase in R-squared values from negative or low to positive, was observed following the integration of these engineered features. LightGBM and XGBoost consistently emerged as the top-performing algorithms across most prediction targets. While the Placement to Release duration proved most predictable, the Release to Departure phase presented the greatest predictive challenge, indicating areas for targeted operational analysis and further feature exploration. The developed models offer valuable insights into dynamic station bottlenecks, providing a data-driven foundation for optimizing railway asset utilization and improving overall operational flow
