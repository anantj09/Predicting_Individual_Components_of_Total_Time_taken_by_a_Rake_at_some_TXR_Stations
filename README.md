# Predicting_Individual_Components_of_Total_Time_taken_by_a_Rake_at_some_TXR_Stations

### ðŸ“œ Overview
This project focuses on predicting the various components of rake turnaround time at several Train Examination (TXR) stations using machine learning. By analyzing a dataset of rake movements, we developed predictive models to forecast critical time intervals, aiming to optimize railway asset utilization and improve operational efficiency. The core of this project lies in extensive feature engineering, particularly the creation of novel congestion metrics to quantify station occupancy in real-time.

While the methodology is applicable across multiple stations, the initial analysis on the DDU station serves as a key case study.
